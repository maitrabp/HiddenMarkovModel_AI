# Testing
 * For successful testing, you must have [Java] & [Java Development Kit] installed.
 * Run the app whether it is using Eclipse, Netbeans, or Visual Studio code or some other IDE.
 * The optimal result will show up on console. 
 * The result is updated after the robot senses, and after it actually moves (these steps are conducted for all cells on the grid, since we dont know initial position of the robot, except blocades).
